## Core Features:

- WhatsApp Dashboard: Manage WhatsApp conversations and messages directly from the dashboard. Integrate with n8n to display messages from an agent connected to WhatsApp with clients. Messages are stored in Supabase.

- AI-Powered Analytics: Automatic summaries and data analysis using generative AI to identify key trends and insights.
